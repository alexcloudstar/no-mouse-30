# No Mouse 30

A 30-day keyboard-first challenge.

I am launching this challenge because I started to feel more and more wrist pain.
Not from coding itself, but from constantly switching to the mouse for small things:
creating folders, navigating UIs, clicking through apps.

This is a constraint to force better habits:
working more in the terminal, learning real shortcuts, and staying in flow.

No perfection required. Just honesty.

## What is the challenge?

For 30 days:
- Work keyboard-only during work and creative time
- Avoid using the mouse or trackpad
- Use shortcuts, terminal commands, and keyboard navigation instead

The mouse is not banned forever.
It is simply no longer the default.

---

## Allowed exceptions

This is not a purity test.

Mouse usage is allowed for:
- Gaming after work
- Emergency UI work that cannot reasonably be done with a keyboard
- Demos or recordings where mouse clarity matters

If you need the mouse, use it.
Just do not use it out of habit.

---

## Why do this?

- Reduce wrist strain
- Spend more time in the terminal
- Stop using UIs for things the keyboard can do faster
- Improve focus by avoiding constant context switching
- Actually learn the shortcuts you half-know

Most developers think they are keyboard-first.
Very few actually are.

## Browser navigation (important)

If you attempt this challenge without keyboard browser navigation, you will struggle.

Use a Vim-style browser extension.

Recommended:
- **Vimium**

Why:
- Open links with `f`
- Scroll with `j` / `k`
- Jump faster with `d` / `u`
- Switch tabs without touching the mouse
- Search pages with `/`

This alone removes a large amount of mouse usage.

I am participating too.
