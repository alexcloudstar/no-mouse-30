# Rules – No Mouse 30

These rules exist to keep the challenge simple, fair, and honest.
This is not about perfection or punishment.
It is about building better habits.

---

## Core rule

During work and creative time:
- Do not use the mouse or trackpad
- Use the keyboard, terminal, and shortcuts instead

The mouse should not be the default input.

---

## Allowed exceptions

Mouse usage is allowed for:
- Gaming after work
- Emergency UI work that cannot reasonably be done with a keyboard
- Demos or screen recordings where mouse clarity is required
- Short unavoidable actions that block progress

Use common sense.
Do not optimize for loopholes.

## Daily progress rules

- One PR per successful day
- One day per PR
- Update only your own participant file
- Change the day status from ⬜ to ✅
- Do not batch multiple days in one PR
- Do not edit other participants’ files

Missed days stay empty.
There is no penalty for skipping days.

---

## PR requirements

PRs that do not follow these rules may be closed:
- Wrong file structure
- Multiple days updated at once
- Editing someone else’s progress
- Retroactive updates

This is not personal.
It keeps the challenge readable and fair.

---

## Honesty clause

This challenge runs on trust.

If you used the mouse a lot on a given day, do not mark it as completed.
Nobody is auditing you.
The value comes from being honest with yourself.
